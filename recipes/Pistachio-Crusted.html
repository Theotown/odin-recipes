    <p>
        This pistachio-crusted rack of lamb has an interesting flavor and texture. A rack of lamb may be a little pricey but no more so <br> than other special-occasion meats like prime rib, beef tenderloin, or goose. And because it's sold completely trimmed, you'll have virtually no waste.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>2 racks of lamb, trimmed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li> â…” cup chopped pistachio nuts</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <ol>
            <span>Step 1</span>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <span>Step 2</span>
            <li> Generously season each rack of lamb with herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <Span>Step 3</Span>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Place lamb into the skillet and cook until browned on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <span>Step 4</span>
            <li> Stir pistachios, bread crumbs, melted butter, and olive oil together in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread mustard over the fatty side of lamb, then press pistachio mixture into mustard.</li>

            <span>Step 5</span>
        <li>  Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden and lamb is pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>

        <span>Step 6</span>
            <li> Transfer lamb to a plate and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
